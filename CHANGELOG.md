## [0.81.14] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **AMD Flash Attention decode kernel** (experimental). A from-scratch Metal kernel
  that runs generation-time attention on discrete AMD GPUs, exposed as a toggle on
  the experimental engine (Settings → Inference engine → Experimental → "AMD Flash
  Attention kernel"). Supports head dims 128 and 256 and KV types f16, q8_0, q4_0
  and turbo2/3/4 (including the asymmetric pairs the TurboQuant engine allows).
  Quantized and `turbo*` KV caches require Flash Attention, which otherwise falls
  back to the CPU on AMD; the kernel keeps it on the GPU (measured ~14 → ~31 t/s
  for turbo KV at 1k context). Prompt processing still runs on the CPU. Off by
  default; the standard engine is unchanged. See the README research note.

### Fixed
- **MTP crash on AMD.** Speculative decoding (`draft-mtp`) could abort mid-generation
  with `GGML_ASSERT(buf_dst)` in the Metal backend: the draft path reads hidden-state
  embeddings back from the GPU through an asynchronous transfer that the AMD staging
  patch did not yet cover. The staging fallback now also wraps that async read path.

## [0.81.1] - 2026-06-12 (pre-release)

First public pre-release. Core functionality is complete and validated on the
reference hardware (Intel Mac + RX 6700 XT 12 GB); broader testing is ongoing
before 1.0.

### Highlights
- Native SwiftUI app for running LLMs locally on Intel Macs with AMD GPUs (Metal).
- Bundled, AMD-patched llama.cpp engines (static, self-contained) — fixes
  corrupted output and PCIe-bound performance on AMD dGPUs (~8× faster than stock).
- Native chat: persistent multi-conversations, full Markdown with code copy,
  regenerate, system prompt, per-message tokens/sec.
- Model manager: curated catalog with per-model VRAM/RAM estimates for the
  detected hardware, Hugging Face search, downloads, one-click delete.
- MoE-aware: automatic `--n-cpu-moe` calculation for 35B-class models on 12 GB GPUs.
- MTP speculative decoding support (+34% generation, lossless).
- Dual engines: official + experimental TurboQuant (KV cache to ~16%,
  100k+ token contexts).
- Benchmarks with history, configuration chips and comparison charts.
- KV cache quantization, `--mlock`, Flash Attention and per-GPU selection.
- Profiles (full config snapshots, engine included), menu bar mode, auto-start.
- Bilingual UI (English/Spanish) with tooltips on every setting and built-in docs.
- OpenAI-compatible API + minimal web chat.
- Donations: Binance Pay and USDT (TRC-20).
- GPL-3.0 license, CI releases, CodeQL analysis, unit tests, update checker,
  weekly automated engine bumps with smoke tests.
